# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has provided the raw data for the recent election, they ask me to preform an audit to evaulate the results of the election. I have been asked to-
1. Calculate total number of votes
2. Get a list of all the candidates that where voted for. 
3. Calculate the total number votes for each canduidate. 
4. Find the percentages for each candidate. 
5. Determine the winner of the election based on populat vote.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code 1.68.1

## Summary
The analysis of the election shows that: 
There were a total of 369,711 total votes. There were 3 candidates Charles Casper, Diana DeGette, Raymon Anthony Doanne. The candidate results were Charles Casper Stockham: received 23.0% of the vote with 85,213 votes. Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote with 272,892 votes. Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote with 11,606 votes. 
The winner of the election is Diana DeGette.

## Challenge Overview
 After finding all unique names in the data it becomes chanllenging to understand the logic when tracking the candidates voter count as it increments + 1 for each candidate. The most chanlleging portion of this task was adjusting intendation to allow code to properly execute.

## Challenge Summary
Audit the election results and determine the winner of the election. Show the percentage and popular vote per candidate.
